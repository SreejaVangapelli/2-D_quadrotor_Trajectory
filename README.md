# 2D quadrotor following a circular trajectory

This project implements an algorithm, for a 2D quadrotor to follow a circular trajectory. The LQ controllers were designed using linearized version of the dynamic equations of the quadrotor.

The following is the simulation of the implemented algorithm with and without disturbances:

Note: This project was done as the part the course Reinforcement learning and optimal control for robotics. The quadrotor.py which describes the dynamics was given by Professor Ludovic Righetti as a part of the class.
