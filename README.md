# 2D quadrotor following a circular trajectory
This project implements an algorithm, for a 2D quadrotor to follow a circular trajectory. The LQ controllers were designed using linearized version of the dynamics of the quadrotor.

The following is the simulation of the implemented algorithm with and without disturbances:

Note: This project was done as the part the course Reinfircement learning and optimal control for robotics and the quadrotor.py file was given by Professor Ludovic Righetti who taught the class.
